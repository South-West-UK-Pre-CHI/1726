The idea o' the South West UK Pre-CHI Event be t' provide an opportunity fer researchers from the South West England 'n De Cymru Human-Computer Interaction Crew (SWEDC-HCI) t' come together t' practice runnin' thar accepted CHI papers 'n work-in-progress research natters, as well as creatin' a smaller safe space fer PhD Students t' discuss thar unpublished work in a doctorial consortium. We also aim t' create a space fer new research connections 'n the ability t' discuss dis research in a smaller circle. Due t' it bein' a free event, 'twill provide an excellent opportunity fer all researchers, regardless o' experience, t' get a taste o' the quality o' work presented at CHI, 'n network wit' peers. Therefore, everyone from students, professors 'n industry folks in the region interested in HCI will be ahoy t' attend.
